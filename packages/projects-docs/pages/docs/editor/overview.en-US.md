CodeSandbox has [many alternatives for you to code](linktoiosandvscode). One of the tools is the unique and opinionated Web Editor, built from scratch and optimized to help the developer focus on what matters: being creative and doing their activities without friction. 

The web editor contains a set of features to increase the accessibility of complex tools like git, setup, review flows, contributions, and visualizing components.
