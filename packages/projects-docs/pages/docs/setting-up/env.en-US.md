# Environment

## Default resources

Currently one of our goals with CodeSandbox Projects beta is to understand the typical resource needs. Based on our learnings the default resources might change in the future.

| Type | Limit |
|------|-------|
| CPU  |  2 vCPU     |
|  Memory    |   4Gi    |

If you hit any limitation during the beta then please [get in touch](mailto:support@codesandbox.io) and the team will adjust the limitations to make sure you can run your project.

## Environment configuration

With the environment file you can configure various aspects of the running VMs. Currently the config allows you to set a specific `nodeVersion` , but more options will be available in the future.

### Getting started

1. Create a new file: `.codesandbox/environment.json`
2. Add your configuration
3. Save the file
4. Commit/Push the file to persist changes when restarting the VM - this is needed to ensure every newly created branch will use the new configuration
5. Open sidebar menu â†’ Restart VM

### Supported configuration

#### NodeJS

<Callout>
If you have already a .nvmrc file containing a node version number in your project's root folder then it will be automatically picked up by CodeSandbox Projects.
</Callout>

The environment file allows you to specify:

- nodeVersion

```json
{
  "nodeVersion": "14"
}
```

#### Node Version

Single value configuration, type `string`, by default it is set to `"16"` .


## Docker support 

CodeSandbox Projects now supports running docker containers inside any workspace. You can run and build images to run containers inside your project by opening a terminal and running `docker`. If you have a docker-compose file in your root folder you have to run only `docker-compose up` and that's all, all your services will run within Projects.

<Callout>
You can also find a tutorial about getting started with Docker [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/tutorial/docker)
</Callout>

## Nix support

Inside CodeSandbox Projects you can use [Nix](https://nixos.org/) as a package manager. Nix is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration. Basically, you can install any additional tools, like go, java, or system packages, inside your workspace.
