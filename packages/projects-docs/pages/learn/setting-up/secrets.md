### Project-level environment variables and secrets

Currently CodeSandbox Projects only supports **project-level** configuration. The secrets and environment variables are shared across all VMs, but it's necessary to restart your workspace after making changes for them to take effect.

### Storage and Encription

Environment variables are stored in our database, AES encrypted. The encryption key is rerolled from time to time on an unannounced schedule and the key is stored separately from the database.

### Privacy

Environment variables are enabled only for **private** repositories and they are only viewable by users with **write access** to the repository.
