# Terminal

![CodeSandbox Projects Terminal](../images/devtools-cover-terminal.jpg)
 
One of the powerful tools from CodeSandbox Projects is the terminal. It's connected to a Virtual Machine and behaviors like your local terminal. It's possible to run any command you are used to:
- git operations
- bash scripts
- package-management commands
- start servers

Because CodeSandbox is built to focus on collaboration, you can see other terminals. Useful when someone on your team encounters some errors or has a hard time fixing a problem, you can jump in and understand what is going on.

Each branch is a new environment, so commands that you run in the terminal will not affect other branches.

If you need to run commands that depend on sudo/root access. <br/>Please check the [tutorial about using nix](/tutorial/docker)
