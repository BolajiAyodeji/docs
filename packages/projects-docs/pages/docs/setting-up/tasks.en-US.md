# .codesandbox/tasks.json

CodeSandox Projects can be configured through the `.codesandbox/tasks.json` configuration file in your project. The contents of this file define a the steps to set up VMs and configure the list of commands to run inside the workspace like webservers, Docker containers, tests etc. 

<Callout>
We also recommend checking these files into version control so that every collaborator on the project has a similar editing experience. This also allows changes to this configuration to be tracked, and for additional changes to be made on specific branches. In addition, once itâ€™s merged to your main branch then you leverage the configuration for every newly created branch.
</Callout>

This is an example of a configuration:

```json
{
  "setupTasks": ["yarn install", "yarn build"],
  "tasks": {
    "install-dependencies": {
      "name": "Install Dependencies",
      "command": "yarn install"
    },
    "start-app": {
      "name": "Run Dev Server",
      "command": "yarn start",
      "runAtStart": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the default configuration

By default, CodeSandbox Projects tries to infer scripts from the `package.json` file in your project's root folder. In addition, you can always use the terminal devtool to execute any shell script to run your project.

## Create a config file

## Setup Tasks

Array of commands that will run sequentially before the workspace will be ready to start your application. If no value is provided, installing dependencies will be the default task (we will detect which package manager you use).

```json
{
  "setupTasks": [
    {
      "name": "Installing Dependencies",
      "command": "yarn install"
    },
    {
      "name": "Building Workspace",
      "command": "yarn build"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tasks Configuration

Tasks are scripts that can be run inside your project. In many cases these will call the scripts in your `package.json`, but they can also be used to run other executables.

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    // Task ID is used to uniquely identify each task, we use it to
    // keep track of the task even if the command changes
    "<task-id>": {
      "name": "Install Dependencies", // this is shown in the UI
      "command": "yarn" // the command to run in a shell
    },
    "<other-task-id>": {
      "name": "Build Project",
      "command": "yarn build"
    }
  }
}
```

This id does not appear on the UI, since each task has a display name configured along side the command it runs.

## Examples 

### A single page application

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "run-dev": {
      "name": "App",
      "command": "yarn run dev",
      "runAtStart": true
    }
  }
}
```

### A mono-repo with multiple frontends

```json
{
	"tasks": {
		"build": {
			"name": "Build Workspace",
			"command": "yarn build:workspace"
		},
    "homepage": {
      "name": "Homepage",
      "command": "yarn workspace homepage dev",
			"runAtStart": true
    },
		"docs": {
      "name": "Docs",
      "command": "yarn workspace docs dev"
    },
		"admin": {
      "name": "Admin",
      "command": "yarn workspace admin dev"
    },
		"dashboard": {
      "name": "Dashboard",
      "command": "yarn workspace dashboard dev"
    }
	}
}
```
