## sudo access

Tipically sudo access allows users to run programs with the privileges of another user, by default, the superuser. Currently, due to security reasons CodeSandbox projects doesn't provide an option to run sudo commands. This is necessary to provide you collaboration features on the top of the ephemeral developer environment experience.
