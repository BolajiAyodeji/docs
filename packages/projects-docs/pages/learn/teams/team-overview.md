# Team and access management

You can organize your work under `Personal Projects` and `Teams` inside CodeSandbox Projects. Your teams are synced across Sandboxes and Projects and every team member can navigate between the imported projects.

For the open beta release, Projects is granting visibility of all projects to teams replicating the existing privacy settings already in place on GitHub.


## Managing your team

Managing your team is possible through the Sandboxes dashboard.
