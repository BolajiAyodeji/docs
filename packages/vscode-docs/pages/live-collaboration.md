# Live Collaboration

## View collaborators

Once you are connected to the branch, you will be able to see a list of teammates that are active on the branch. You can see the list of collaborators as well as the environment they are working from.

In this case, I am active in both VS Code and the CodeSandbox editor. 

## Multiplayer Changes
