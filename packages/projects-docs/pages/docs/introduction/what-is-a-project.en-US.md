# What is a CodeSandbox Project

Compared to a classic Sandbox that runs on the client, a Project allows you to run large services directly on a server.

You could compare it to your local development, where you need to start different services and trigger even your custom build that will create a preview server on localhost.

You have all this now available running on a server, that can even be experienced by multiple people at the same time. 

# Git Based

Projects are git based, as it's the tool of choice for developers around the world. We tightly integrate with **GitHub** to make it easy to use CodeSandbox for activel development but don't lose all the benefits that you are used from GitHub.

Currently you can only import GitHub Projects.

## One Branch, One Instance

Branching is a core concept in CodeSandbox Projects. The exciting part is that each branch has one environment running your application. So it's easy to demo and cooperate on features together, or review branches in action. If you work alone or as a team.
You also have 1-click-alternate-dev-environments that just work!
