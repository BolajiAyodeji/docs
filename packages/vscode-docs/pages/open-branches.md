# Open your branch in VS Code

You can jump to VS Code at anytime from the browser

Alternatively, you can do all your work in VS Code without accessing CodeSandbox on the web

1) Open the extension
2) Sign in if you haven’t already
3) Select the ‘Projects’ panel and select the project you want to work on. From there you can open a new branch or select an existing branch to open

You will only be able to select from a list of repositories that have been imported to CodeSandbox. If you don’t see your project in the list, check your dashboard on CodeSandbox to make sure everything is set up there first.

If at any point, you want to switch to the CodeSandbox editor, simply click ‘Open in CodeSandbox’ under the ‘Branch Control Panel’
