# Pricing FAQs

## Can I try a Pro Subscription before I commit?
Yes. Trials are available for Team Pro. You can learn more [here](/learn/plan-billing/trials)

## Can I switch my billing to be annual or monthly after I subscribe?
When you sign up for a subscription, you are given a choice between monthly and annual billing. If you select one and are unhappy with your choice, you will have the option to change it at the start of the next billing cycle if you contact [support](mailto:support@codesandbox.io)

## Can I sign up for a trial without adding my credit card information?
At this time, a credit card is required to sign up fo a trial. If you don't have access to one at the time of creating a team, you can always sign up for a trial by navigating to team settings.

If you are an admin, you will see an option to start a free trial.

## Why can't I see my subscription information on my team settings page?
Only team admins have access to subscription details and option to manage a subscription. Non-admins (team members with editor and viewer roles) will not see the same options in the team settings page.
