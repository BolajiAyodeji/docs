# iOS Docs

CodeSandbox for iOS offers a full-fledged development environment with all the tools you need to develop projects of any size. Create a sandbox to quickly prototype your ideas or work on a large codebase with CodeSandbox Projects: whatever your needs are we have you covered.

## Getting Started

### Installation

CodeSandbox for iOS is available for free on the App Store and you can get it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-js-javascript-ide/id1423330822).

### Authenticating with CodeSandbox

While you donâ€™t need a CodeSandbox account to use the app, the experience will be limited to developing offline sandboxes. The app combined with your CodeSandbox account will give you access to your sandboxes hosted on CodeSandbox, live collaboration and a huge range of sandbox templates to get you started. In addition, a CodeSandbox account is required to access Projects and develop projects of any size.
