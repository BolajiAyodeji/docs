# CodeSandbox Sandboxes
![sandbox-general](TODO: Lena create an image to represent sandbox prototyping)

Sandboxes are the environment for rapid web development.

<Tabs tabs={["Browser", "Cloud", "iOS"]}>

       ## What is a Cloud Sandbox
       Unlike Browser Sandboxes that run on your browser. Cloud Sandboxes run on a virtual machine. Cloud Sandboxes are great for any protoytyping needs, but they really shine when working on projects that require the use of the server. 
       You can learn more about the editor and the unique functionalities of the cloud developer environment in [Repositories](/learn/repositories/overview). Cloud Sandboxes and Repositories run on the same infrastructure and use the same editor. The main distinctions between the two is that Sandboxes are built for prototyping while Repositories are built for full scale development. Once you scale a Sandbox to a Repository, you will have 
       - Integration with VS Code
       - Branching
       - Git Tooling 
       - Full integration with GitHub
