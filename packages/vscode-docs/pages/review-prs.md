# Reviewing PRs in VSCode

You can review PRs directly from VSCode while connected to CodeSandbox. To do this, you should install the [GitHub App of CodeSandbox](/docs/integrations/github-app). With this app, every PR will have a link to open the branch in VSCode.

We also recommend to install the [GitHub Pull Request](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, and configure it as a default extension in your user settings (as outlined [here](#default-user-extensions)). With this extension you can put comments on GitHub directly from your editor.
