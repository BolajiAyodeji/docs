# Your first project

Start working on a project by importing an existing repository from GitHub or creating from a template.

## Importing a project

1. Go to the new **[Projects Dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/p/dashboard)**.

2. From the left sidebar, click on the **team** (personal or another) you want to import your project into. New teams can be created through the [Sandbox Dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard).
  
3. Click on the **`New Project`** button.
    
4. Enter a valid **GitHub URL** or choose a repository from the pre-loaded repository list.

For valid GitHub URLs, follow this format:

**`https://` `github.com/` `:org/` `:repo`**
- Include the protocol, such as `https`;
- Don't include branch name;
- for example `https://github.com/facebook/react`.
</Callout>

- If the search does not return any matches, click on the **`Show all`** button under the last repository visible in the list to load more repositories.

- If not all your GitHub organizations are listed in the dropdown, click on **`Manage GitHub integrations`** to grant the required permissions.
 
6. Click on **Import**. 

## Creating from a template

1. Go to your team's page and click on the **`New Project`** button.
    
1. Choose a template from our curated list displayed in the right column.
 
1. Select the **GitHub organization** to create this repository in.

1. Choose a **Repository name**. This name will be the same one used in Projects and GitHub.

1. Click on **`Create project`**.


## Troubleshooting
   
#### **Permission errors while importing a project**
    
- Verify your team's permission to open CodeSandbox Projects.

- Verify your **repository permissions on GitHub**. 
You need to have `write` permission on Github to be able to import the project. Repositories where you only have `read` access can only be forked.

- Verify your **GitHub permissions**. 
CodeSandbox Projects requires full git access to be able to import and commit. If you face any  authentication errors, follow the steps to reset your github permissions listed below.
    
    
#### **Resetting Github permissions**

1. Go to the **[Sandboxes Dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard)**.

1. Click on the **Menu icon** at the top right of the screen.

1. Click on **Preferences**.

4. Go to **Integrations**. 

5. **Sign out from GitHub and sign in again** to reconnect your GitHub Account. 
  
#### **Invalid authorization code on Firefox and Safari**
    
Safari and Firefox block popups by default. Please make sure you give the domain permission (through browser settings) or refresh the page after you opened the popup and try again.
