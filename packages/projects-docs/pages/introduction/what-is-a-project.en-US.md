# What is a CodeSandbox Project

CodeSandbox Projects is the next level of developement environment tools. Hosted in the cloud is built foucus on speed, open source and collaboration. It allows you to run repositories of any size.

CodeSandbox run on microVMs techonology that you can configure on the size of you project. All this is availableto be experienced by multiple people at the same time. 

## Integrated with repositories

A key feature of Projects is that every branch is its own development environment, backed by a unique URL. This means that you can share your branch with someone else, and they will always be able to see a running branch, even if you’re offline.

This feature shines when you’re working on a branch, and you need to quickly review a PR. You won’t have to worry about stashing, running yarn install, or rolling back migrations on your current branch. You can just open the branch of the PR in a new window and do the review!

## A running environment in seconds

With CodeSandbox Projects we run the repositories on containers. When you press fork, we create a new branch and development environment, with running dev servers, within a couple seconds.

This means that if you’re looking at someone’s PR, and you want to test a quick suggestion, you can click “Fork”, make your change, and share a link to the new branch with those changes. If you’re happy with the changes, you can merge that
into the existing PR. All of this can be done within a minute.

## Works with VSCode

You can open any branch directly in your local VSCode, and you can use all the extensions and keybindings that you’ve already configured. On top of this, all editors can collaborate seamlessly, so someone can use the online editor to follow you in VSCode.

## Tailored for your project

Just like with CodeSandbox, we’ve built CodeSandbox to integrate directly with your project in an opinionated way. This doesn’t only make you faster as a developer, it makes development more accessible for others who are getting introduced to coding.

## Develop on the go on your iPad/iPhone with a native app

You can pick up where you left off, or develop from scratch from an iPad or iPhone, with all the functionality that you would expect from a development environment.
