# What is CodeSandbox Projects

**CodeSandbox Projects** is the next level of development environment tools. It was built with a focus on speed and collaboration and allows you to create a workspace to be experienced by multiple people at the same time. 


## Tailored for your project

Just like with CodeSandbox, we’ve built Projects to integrate directly with your project in an opinionated way.  

Hosted in the cloud, it runs on microVMs technology that are configurable to the size of your project. Not only does this make you faster as a developer, but it makes overall development more accessible for developers of all levels.


## Integrated with repositories

In Projects, **every branch is its own development environment, backed by a unique URL**. This means that you can share your branch and it will always be running, even if you’re offline.

This feature is specially useful when you’re working on a branch and need to quickly review a PR. Don't worry about stashing, running `yarn install`, or rolling back migrations on your current branch. Just open the PR branch's in a new window and start reviewing!

## A running environment in seconds

At Projects, we run the repositories on containers. When you press `Branch`, we create a new branch and development environment with running dev servers within a few seconds.

If you are looking at someone’s PR and want to quickly test a suggestion, simply click `Branch`, write the code and share a link to your changes. If you’re happy with the changes, merge that
into the existing PR. All of this in under a minute.

## Works with VSCode

Open any branch directly in your local VSCode and use all the extensions and keybindings that you’ve already configured. On top of this, all editors can collaborate seamlessly, so someone can use the online editor to follow you in VSCode.

## Develop on the go on your iPad/iPhone with a native app

Pick up where you left off or develop from scratch from an iPad or iPhone with all the functionalities that you would expect from a development environment.
