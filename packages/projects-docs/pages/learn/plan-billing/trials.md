# Trials


Trials are a way for teams to try out a pro subscription before committing to a plan. If you are curious about how increased VM specs would feel or if you want to test out collaboration with more of your team members, a Team Pro Trial is a perfect way to go. 

## About Trials

When you sign up for a trial, you are starting a Team Pro Subscription with a 14 day free test period. 

Only team admins have permission to start a trial. Trial related notifications and actions are customized to the role of the user. Non-admins may see notifications to upgrade to pro for more options, but only users with an admin role will be able to start or cancel a trial or subscription. 
As soon as the admin has complete the Stripe regisration for a trial, all the Pro features will become avaialbe to the team. [View the full list here](https://codesandbox.io/pricing)

## Getting the most out of the trial
Each team has different needs and use cases. By starting a trial, team members can experience all of the Pro features and determine what best facilitates their work.

### Increased editor seats
By adding your team members to CodeSandbox, you can experience the possibilities of CodeSandbox collaboration without compromise. 

### More VM Specs
Trials allow teams to work on higher specs, thereby reducing potential frustration with speed or memory limits

### Access to Private Repositories
If you are working on a private project, there is no better test for if an experience is right for you than working in a real project. Importing private repositories is fast and secure and allows the team to try out new workflows within everyday context. 

## End of Trial

If, at the end of the trial, you decide Team Pro isn't right for you, it's no sweat. That is what trials are for. 

As the team draws close to the end of the trial period, everyone will see notifications letting them know that the trial will end soon. Admins will see this as well as a call to action to 'Manage Subscription' where they will have a chance to end the trial if they desire.

Once the trial has been cancelled, the team will be moved back into a Free Team Subscription.

Editors that are over the 5 person limit will be changed to a `viewer` role, VM specs will return to the free limits and private Repositories and Sandboxes will become `view-only`.

However, if the trial is not ended, billing for the Pro Subscription will start right after so the team can keep on working without interruption. Don't worry, admins will get an email notifciation in advance of this as well.
